# reactWeather
To get some experience with React, I rebuilt a simple vanilla javascript weather app I made.
Both versions are in progress and have not yet benefited from a refactoring

**react version:** https://statuesque-travesseiro-24624f.netlify.app/

**original:** https://subtle-mousse-767a68.netlify.app/
